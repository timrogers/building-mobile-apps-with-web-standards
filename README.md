Building Mobile Apps with Web Standards
=======================================

Build Mobile Apps with Web Standards is a presentation made by [Tim Rogers](http://www.tim-rogers.co.uk) at Twitter Developer Nest in London on 7th September 2010.

It is a presentation explaining how you can build native mobile applications for iOS, Android and other platforms using the open source projects [jQTouch](http://www.phonegap.com) and [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com).

What is in all the directories?
--------------------------------

The **/code** directory contains all the code samples seen in the presentation. This includes all the raw Javascript and HTML files, and their syntax-highlighted RTF versions, created with highlighter, that are used in the presentation. A copy of the jQTouch library is also packaged into the project, for testing the sample jQTouch application made in one of the slides. **I do not claim any ownership rights to this part of the release, and it is subject to the jQTouch license.** There is also a desktop demo of the sample application included for Windows, Mac and Linux.

The **/images** directory includes the images used in the presentation, such as logos and screenshots.

The **/presentation** directory contains the actual presentation in a large variety of formats, including:

- Keynote Presentation (.key) - the presentation was created in Apple Keynote '09, and presented from this format.
- Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt) - a copy of the presentation, compatible with Microsoft's extremely popular Powerpoint application. There are some issues with the visual appearance and layout in this version, but it is completely readable and useable.
- PDF (.pdf) - each slide packaged into Adobe's incredibly popular document format, compatible with just about every platform. The text is selectable, so this is probably better than the image version in most cases.
- Web version (.html and images) - exported from Keynote as an HTML presentation, this is viewable in all modern web browsers and is made up of HTML, some Javascript and an image of each 'moment' of the presentation. You can click through at your own pace, just as with the original presentation version.
- Images (.png) - These are for convenience, if you want to look at individual slides with maximum compatibility. These are grouped into two folders - in the "/Images (Click-by-Click)" folder, there is a separate image for each click of the presentation, so you can watch it as it would have appeared. In the "/Images (Slide-by-Slide)" directory, there is an image for each slide, skipping out the intermediate steps as the slides are built.
- QuickTime movie (.mov) - an interactive movie, which you can click through at your own pace, compatible with Apple's QuickTime player on Windows and Mac.

What can I do this?
--------------------

Primarily, just enjoy the presentation and learn what you can from it. You can also remix it as you will, as long as you release your update version to the public as I have - if you do anything cool with it, send a message on GitHub and I will take a look.

Thanks and credits
